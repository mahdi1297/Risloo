## Some notes
There were much more to do for this sample project
for example: I could use ISR method to generate a page for every single center but because of time i did not.

I could write unit tests, but time did not allowed me to do that.

I could do much more things for SEO, for example using schema for center detail pages.

In this verion, Every Center is visible via client side and is not suitable for seo. But again if we use ISR and create a detail page for every single center, the problem will be solved.
